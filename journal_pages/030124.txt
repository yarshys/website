I don't know what this journalling is.

But it will be interesting, I don't know how I want my life to play out. I try to be someone I want to be instead of have to be. It might just be insanity, or I am at the top of Mount Stupid but a boy can dream

just watched Love Actually with my mum. Depressed now, realised how miserable I am.

Just want to be the guy which some people from my past will look at me and think. Really? that can't be him, he has changed so much. (Hopefully for the better)

Thats all for now, another day tomorrow.
